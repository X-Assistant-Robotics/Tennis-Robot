# Tennis-Robot

This is a project of a tennis robot that can help people play tennis.
We'll call him "Ball boy - Deshigaoya" for now, and he can help us pick up balls, keep score, time reminders, serve tea and water, anything you'd expect to get on a non-competitive tennis court, except being your opponent, at least not right now.
